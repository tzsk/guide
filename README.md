# Innofied Guide for PHP Laravel

> This is just a standard way we should write code so that everyone can understand eachother's code and perform on them.

In this guid I will explain some best practices and set some universal standards for our internal use only, to how to go about Creating an applicaion in Laravel.

There will be certain steps dedicated to coding standards and some for building Backend for the Admin and also there will be a section for API Building and how to go about securing the API.

Next, I will also get into the optimization parts specifically for Laravel then will also touch on managing server. This section will hugely rely on the size of the Application we are building. I will explain the best way forward for each of them, according to me.


> **NOTE:** This is just my personal experience. If you have suggestions for better improment of the Code and Architecture please feel free to suggest ideas.
