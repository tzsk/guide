# System Configuration & Softwares

This is the step to improve the Workflow of an individual for Developing in Laravel. This is not mandatory but this step will help you in the process of coding.

In this step I'll also provide the softwares to use for improved workflow.

Let's get started,

## Softwares

According to me the top 3 Text editors / IDE for PHP development are:

1. PHPStorm.
2. VSCode.
3. Sublime Text.

`PHPStorm` is undoubtedly the best IDE out there for PHP development. But, `PHPStorm` is very expensive and System Resource Intensive. So the next best thing is `VSCode`. It is too awesome to be true, but we have to equip this with some Extensions to actually make it as par with PHPStorm.

**VSCode Extensions:**

1. PHP Intelephense (Not Intelesence)
2. PHP DocBlockr
3. PHP Getters & Setters
4. PHP File Types
5. php cs fixer

> Will talk more about `CS: Code Sniffer` and CS Fixer in coding standards.

## Environment

There are few things that should be installed properly. There should be no Environment mix match between developers. This is very rare thing to do but we have to try to make it as similar as possible.

Things should be installed:

1. Apache or Nginx
2. PHP >= 7.1
3. MySQL >= 5.7
4. Node JS Latest
5. Redis
6. Supervisord
7. ElasticSearch (Just in case)

> Redis & Supervisord will be used for Queue Job handeling.
