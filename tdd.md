# TDD: Test Driven Development

This is where we write tests for a feature or integration then make it work in the code. In the end we will have a big `Test Suit` to back our requirements. 

In futuer if any changes come we can easly identify where all it affected and how we can cahnge to fix it.

There are 2 types of tests available with Laravel:

1. Unit Test
2. Integration Test (Feature Test)

But it has a tradeoff. It is time consuming. Generally it takes about 30-40% more time during development if we go this route and it also depends on the developer how deeply he/she wrote tests for their respective coding that they did.

But we should consider this as an option for the future.
